# Operation-Mimir
Just a Side Project to Replicate "Steins Gate 0" Phone UI in Unity .
### Note : 
1. UI is for Smartphones. *Since Dev Build 9 (Optimised) ,Only supports 9:19 Aspect Ratio.*
2. This code is shit but it does the job pretty well.
3. The Test Builds were almost complete when this repo was made. So DONT expect much progress.
4. This repo is just to fill my empty Github profile.
5. Check out Steins Gate (Anime And Visual Novel) if you haven't.
